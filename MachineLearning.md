# Machine Learning
- ML is a type of AI building methods that allow machines to learn
- Data is leveraged to improve computer performance on a set of task
- Make prediction based on the data used to train the model.
- no Explict programming rules ::- we just feed data to the Algo

# Deep Learning
- Process more complex pattern in the data then traditional ML
- Deep learning because there more than one layer of learning
Example:- computer vision - Image classification,object detection and image segmentation
- Requires GPU
- Large amount of input data

# Generative AI
- Subnet of Deep learning
- Multi purpose foundation model backed by neural network
- They can be fine tuned fit our usecase
