# Different Prompting Techniques

## Zero-shot prompting
Asking an AI model to perform a task without giving it any examples first.

Example
You ask a well-educated person:
- Explain income tax slabs in simple terms
- Summarize the differences between the old and new tax regimes.

## When zero-shot prompting works best
- Common tasks (summarization, explanation)
- General knowledge questions
- Well-defined instructions
- Strong base models (GPT, Claude)

## Few-shot prompting
- Showing the AI a few examples of how you want a task done, and then asking it to do a similar task.
- Few-shot prompting is guiding an AI by giving it a few examples before asking it to perform a task.
